<table><tr><td> <em>Deliverable 1: </em> API Data Association </td></tr><tr><td><em>Status: </em> <img width="100" height="20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54863474/211707773-e6aef7cb-d5b2-4053-bbb1-b09fc609041e.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Consider how your API data will be associated with a user</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The API data will be associated with the user via a watchlist. The<br>user is able to search for any movie/show he wants thanks to the<br>API, and then add it to his own watchlist to then rate/review. A<br>user can type in the search bar only a part of a movie/shows<br>title and all closely related movies will appear. Whenever a movie/show is selected,<br>that movie&#39;s data such as image, title, release date, etc. is stored in<br>the database and is associated with each users unique ID. That data can<br>then be called from database into the user&#39;s watchlist and show a personalized<br>array of movies with their own details.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Handling Data Changes</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Each user&#39;s watchlist contains movies that they added for themselves to see. And<br>each movie has the option to be rated, and these ratings can be<br>looked at. The ratings for each entity can be manually updated and the<br>user can actually see new ratings if they decide to update it manually.<br>So if a user gave a movie a 5/10 rating and decided that<br>he would like to update that rating, he is able to and the<br>rating is updated in the database and on the display. The way this<br>works is that each movie and rating is associated with a user, and<br>I am able to update the rating column in the database whenever the<br>user decides to update the rating for a movie. And then I&#39;m able<br>to display the new updated rating by calling that table that has it.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>One of the biggest struggles was being able to change and assign movies<br>to users who are not yourself. So an admin putting a movie on<br>another users watchlist. And I put that into a recommendation page as to<br>not get mixed with their regular watchlist. I thought that was a real<br>life good application to think ahead about because the user shouldn&#39;t feel like<br>he doesn&#39;t understand where certain movies came from. So I created the recommend.php<br>file and assign_movies.php file. The assign movies take movies from the admins watchlist<br>and can select any user to add to.

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Overall how do you feel you did with the project and meeting requirements</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I felt like I did very good with the project. It was a<br>steep learning curve at first. After re-watching and reading the modules multiple times<br>some things just started to click. I feel with all my work and<br>time put in this, I feel I got a 100%. This was no<br>easy task and I had to spend hours coding which was something new<br>to me.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Summarize your experience per the checklist items</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had 0 web development experience. I took CS100 python but that didn&#39;t<br>do me too good for this course, and I had to learn so<br>much in so little time. At this point, I am very happy about<br>my current experience. I&#39;ve learned so much and the professor&#39;s course and teaching<br>made me fee like a real developer now. So many new technologies and<br>I feel like I&#39;m proficient with them now. Only thing I would do<br>differently is work even faster than before to finish my milestones in time.<br>My grades really took a hit and I am really aiming for that<br>A. Hopefully with how much time and effort I put in these milestone<br>Project and demo, it will pay off at the end.<br></p><br></td></tr>
